# All-NBA-Team-Analysis
** Authors: Harmandip Singh 

## Overview

This project analyzes and predicts whether NBA players will potentially become First, Second, or Third-ALL NBA team candidates or not. It is a binary classification problem and offers key insights into what potentially makes a player a star after their data in their first three years in the league. The data showed that their were several key metrics that identified a futre star and also showed a changing landscape in the NBA. One of the most important predictors were the number of Free thorw attempts a player takes. This is apparant to many avid fans in the NBA who watch playerslike James Harden continually get calls from referees. Many argue with the way fouls are called the ability to draw them is a skill in of itself and this was certainly reflected in the models. We also gained insights into the changing of the NBA and its approach to less positional basketball. In previous era there were more big men likely to become All-NBA type players but in recent years Point Guards(even more than SG) are the most likely to be voted to the ALL-NBA team. The league has also moved towrds attempting more three point percentage shots in recent years and finding players who excel at Three pointers while having the ability to generate free throws is the best predictor. 


## Business Problem
The League is largely star driven and it is important for teams to identify All-NBA potential players to suceed. Although players may join the All-NBA team in their first three years they usually join down the line. It is important for teams to identify which of these players are stars coming off thier rookie deals and who they should pay max money for or trade for if possible. 

# Data 
   
   The data was collected from the official NBA Website using and API as well as the Basketball Reference site which collect stats for players going back many years. Individual player data was pulled for all seasons in their career and contained more than 30000 rows and 25 features. The data was filtered down to players who played into their third seasons for 3000 rows of data. The target variable was whether or not players were part fo the esteemed 15 best players in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd All-NBA team. The data consisted of an unbalance target group since only 15 players are selected each seasons.
